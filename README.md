This project "landing-page" is a part of the curriculum for learning web development, from The Odin Project(TOP).

In this project I'll be using my skills from the foundation course so far, which include basic knowledge of git, HTML, CSS, and CSS Flexbox. My goal here is to replicate and build a basic web page from scratch, which is provided by the wonderful team of TOP. I'll also commit my whole process of building this web page, so as to develop a habit of committing, and to better learn the art of commit. 

P.S. Thank you team TOP for this wonderful and Free course!
